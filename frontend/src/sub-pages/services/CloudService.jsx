                - Cloud Migration is considered as the adoption of cloud computing. Literally understood as a
                'relocation' of all the documents, data, and processes from some data centers to a cloud
                infrastructure, transferring the burden of server maintenance and application management to an
                external location and usually to a specialized supplier.

              <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
                - To successfully implement Cloud Migration, businesses can consider using one or more
                'clouds' to ensure efficiency and storage capacity not only at present but also in the
                upcoming business development phase.

                - In fact, you don't need to worry much about the methods and implementation, as well as the
                certain impacts, because when you choose the right well-established partner with years of
                experience and reputation, Cloud Migration will be faster and more efficient than you think.

              prioritize applications to switch. Another important task is the cost assessment, we will
              consider based on the system of subjective as well as objective factors to come up with the
